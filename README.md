## Sustainable Recipes. A Food Recipe Sourcing and Recommendation System to Minimize Food Miles


## AIM:  

This project aims to connect ingredients in food recipes with organic food producers in the USA. The rationale behing the algorithm that connects both parts is to minimize the distance that food will travel from the farms or handlers to the places that want to produce the food recipe. The algorithm works in two ways.

## 1. Supply Chain Minimization Problem for a Recipe

Given a location that wants to produce a recipe, the algorithm recommends the nearest organic food producer of each one of the ingredients needed to prepare the recipe. It also provides a ticket containing contact information for each producer along with the miles that each ingredient will travel and the total miles that all ingredients will travel from the suppliers to the recipe producing location.

## 2. Recipe recommendation System

Given a location that wants to produce a recipe I have built a recipe recommendation system that recommends recipes that minimize food miles,
